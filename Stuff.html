                Dear Ahmed, <br>

                <br> Happy Birthday, my love! <br> 

                <br> It’s hard to think of where to start. There are so many reasons why I love you and it would take up so many pages listing these reasons so, maybe I’ll just start with a little reminiscing. <br>
                
                <br>I remember the time I first talked to you. In my eyes, I saw someone who was the complete opposite of me, a talkative, confident, and energetic person. I admired you (and I still do now), but I never could get it across why each day you’d come and talk to little ol’ me. I honestly was a bit intimidated by just the aura of positivity you gave off each day you came to class. But, despite that, I appreciated how not only you were so attentive but how you let me distract myself from the depression I had at the time.
                
                I looked forward to every day that you would come sit with me before class. I remember how before a major speech, I would always look to you for help, and I appreciate how you took time to help me in those moments. Each time you took a moment to walk with me to the garage was something that lifted my spirits up and made my steps feel a little lighter. Ahmed, if you weren’t there for me, I don’t think I would’ve confided in anyone. I would’ve ended up bottling all the negativity inside and the fact you were so welcoming and warm to someone like me was something that I held dear to me. You were so open with me that I, for what felt like the first time, felt open enough to talk about my emotions. Each time I called you, you always cheered me up. And honestly, I never would have thought and even taken action to call you if you weren’t so open and welcoming to me. So, thank you, truly, for everything you did during that time. Even though I was still a wilted flower, you helped me stand up a little harder than I did before. If there is one thing I do regret, it’s not hugging you at least once, haha. Also, I think one of the most prevalent memories that come to me while I write this is that one time you sat directly next to me and UConn was giving free cupcakes to people (Take that as you will, I can’t question my mind’s logic). <br>
                <br>Ahmed, when I reached out to you, I did it for two reasons. I wanted to see how you were doing, but, I also wanted to reach out for your hand. The way you reached out to me at UConn filled me with this tiny bit of hope that maybe through talking to you, I could finally tackle the darkness within me. When I reached out my hand, I knew that I could change when you grabbed on and pulled me back to my feet.  And just like you, I never thought that the effect of me reaching out to you would be leading us to this point. Ahmed, Ame Ame, my tall sunflower, my love, you taught me so many things. From learning to tackle and eject sus black to the definition of love, these past few months have nurtured what was a wilting flower into full bloom. You helped me in so many ways, and I can’t start to think of how to pay your back for what you helped me bloom into. At a time where I quit playing games, watching anime, and everything that I did previously, you helped me realize that I missed being able to do the things I loved. You introduced me to Arknights, we watched anime together, I watched you play Code Vein and gush over Io. I remember all these sweet memories, and I’m so grateful that these memories are with you. Thank you for taking out the fear within me and putting in things I love. Thank you for helping me recognize that I can love, and thank you for helping me accept me for who I am. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for us, what else I can learn from you, and for the memories that we’ll create. <br>
               
                
                <br> Now that I’ve gushed out my memories with you, let’s talk <em>about</em> you. Ahmed, I am so proud of you and if I didn’t make it apparent enough, I really admire you for all that you do and have done. The way you communicate with me and consider things that I don’t think of, it just makes me filled with a sense of awe and appreciation for you. When I started talking to you again, I had this sense I was cheering you on from the sidelines, watching you work toward your goals in IT. I know I might not make this apparent enough sometimes, but I’m really happy that you’ve received great opportunities for the work you’ve done. You deserve it. And, I support you through each decision you make as a little Anu-ne cheering you on from the sidelines and by your side. Be proud of yourself and flex those (gosh dang it its Ramadan) biceps and owning your accomplishments. Also, from me, give yourself a pat on the back (but know once we meet in person, I’ll be doing a lot more than giving you a pat on the back hehe). <br>
                <br>Alright mister 24, before I start gushing about how much I love your beautiful smile and that cute little peace sign picture you sent me on my birthday oh no too late- <br>
                <br>Yeah I didn’t make an effort to stop that…anyway! Ahmed, Ame Ame, my tall sunflower…I love you. I’m grateful for having met you and taking the chance to get to know you. I love you so much and it’s hard not to cry thinking about how much I love you because it just makes me really happy thinking about you. Nevertheless, happy birthday my love, and I even though I couldn’t gift you properly today, know that next year I will definitely be keeping my mouth shut and attempting to surprise you <em>(If you technically think about it, I could put a bowtie on my head and say I am the present this year I mean what-)</em><br>
                <br>Sincerely, <br> 
                <br> Your klutzy and cute Anu-ne <br> 
                <br> P.S, hopefully you didn't find this whole letter on a website concept too cheesy, but even if you did, too bad! Hehe~<br>
